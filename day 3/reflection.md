# Day 3 reflection

Today I learnt all about numbers. Some of my key take-aways are:

- complex numbers, "2 + 3j"
- floating numbers, "2.25"
- using mathematical signs in python, "+,-,%,\*,/"
- collecting numerical data from the user, "input("Enter base: ")"
- some function that deal with numbers and what they do, "int, float"
- how to check for the data type of an element, "type()"
