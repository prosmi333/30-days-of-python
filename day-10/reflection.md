# Day 10 reflection

Today I learn't about loops. Here is what I recall from todays lesson:

- Loopsare used when you want to repeat a certain task
- There are 2 types of loops in python: for loops and while loops
- For loops should be used when dealing with a range
- While loops should be used when you want to do something until something is true. eg. I want to keep walking until I reach the store.
