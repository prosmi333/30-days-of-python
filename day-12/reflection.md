# Day 12 reflection

Today I learn't about modules. Here's what I recall from today's lesson:

- A module is a file containing a set of codes or a set of functions which can be included to an application
- To import a file we use the _import_ keyword and the name of the file
- Python has many built in modules such as: _math, os,sys, random, statistics_
- The _os_ module makes it possible to automatically perform many operating system tasks
- The _sys_ module provides functions and variables used to manipulate different parts of the Python runtime environment
- The _math_ module contains many mathe mathematical operations.
- The _random_ module aloows us to generate random numbers
