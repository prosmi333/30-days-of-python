# Day 17: Exception Handling

Today I learned about handling exceptions in python. Here's what I recall from todays lesson.

- Python uses _try_ and _except_ to handle errors smoothly
- The _packing_ method allows functions to take unlimited amount of arguments
- The _enumerate_ function allows us to get the index of each item in the list
- _zip_ allows us to combine lists as we loop through them
