# Day 18: Regular Expressions

- A RegEx A regular expression or RegEx is a special text string that helps to find patterns in data
- It can be used to check if a pattern exists in a different data type.
- It is a module so to use it first you have to import it
- The _match_ method searches only in the beginning of the first line of the string and returns matched objects if found, else returns **None**
- _search_ returns a match object if there is one anywhere in the string
- _findall_ returns a list containing all matches
- _split_ splits the list at the match points and returns a new list
- _sub_ replaces one or many matches with a string
