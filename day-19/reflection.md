# Day 19: File Handling

- We store our data in different file formats(.txt, .json, .xml, .csv, .tsv, .excel)
- The most common format is .txt
- File handling allows us to create, read, update and delete files
- It has its own functions such as _open(), read(), readline(),readlines(),splitlines(), close()_ and _remove()_
