# Day 21: Classes and Objects

Today I learn't about classes and objects in Python. Here are some key points I recall from todays lesson.

- Python is an object oriented programming language
- A class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects
  - The class defines attributes and the behavior of the object, while the object represents the class
  - Every element in a Python program is an object of a class
- To create a class we use the key word _class_ followed by the name and colon
  - Class names should be _CamelCase_
- We create objects by calling the class
- Methods are functions which belong to the object
- Inheritence allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from parent class
  - The parent class gives all the methods and properties
    - It's like a child inheriting it's parents features
