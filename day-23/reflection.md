# Day 23: Virtual Environments

- Virtual environments can help us to create an isolated or separate environment for our project
- Helps avoid conflicts in dependencies across projects
- **_venv_** should be **included to your .gitignore** file so it doesn't get tracked by github
- activate the newly created virtual environment using if using Git Bash on Windows `source venv/Scripts/activate`
