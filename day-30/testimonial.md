# My thoughts on the 30DaysOfPython course

This course was incredibly insightful and well-structured. I feel that I’ve gained a significant amount of knowledge and understanding from it. I’m truly grateful to the author for the effort, clarity, and thoughtfulness that went into creating such a valuable learning experience. I would still like to point out that some of the lessons have some minor error(i.e. spelling mistakes etc.) and it would be wonderful if the author could fix them.
