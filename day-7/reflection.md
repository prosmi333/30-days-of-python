# Day 7 reflection

Today I learn't about sets in Python. Here are the things that I recall from today's lesson.

- Sets in Python are very similar to sets in math
- remove() displays an error if an element isn't in the set but discard() doesn't
- add() only allows one item at a time but update() allows as many as you want
- update() has to have it's parameter as a list
