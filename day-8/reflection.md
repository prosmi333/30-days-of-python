# Day 8 reflection

Today I learnt about dictionaries. Here are my take-aways from todays lesson:

- A dictionary is a collection of unordered, modifiable and paired data type
- Dictionaries in Python are very similar to Objects in JavaScript. They both have a key and a value
- You can use curly brackets or the built in function dict() to create a new dictionary
